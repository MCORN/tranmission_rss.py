TVTRss - RSS torrent downloader for Transmission-daemon

Transmission does not support RSS feeds, neither in the GUI nor the daemon so I wrote this script to fetch torrents from my favourite site. 

This script will check your RSS torrent feed url, grab the URL to each available torrent and add them to transmission via the transmission RPC

The script is designed to work with transmission-daemon on a headless server but it should work with the GUI version on a desktop. (not tested)
